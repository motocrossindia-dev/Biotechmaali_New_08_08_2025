# 🎯 GOOGLE PLAY COMPLIANCE FIX - FINAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED ✅

## 🚨 ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED
The Google Play rejection was due to **READ_MEDIA_IMAGES/READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permissions** being included in your app bundle, which violates Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy for apps that only need one-time access to media files.

## ✅ COMPLETE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:

1. **✅ ADDED `image_picker: ^1.1.2`** - Google Play compliant photo selection package
2. **✅ REPLACED corrupted PDF viewer** with browser-based solution (no storage permissions needed)
3. **✅ VERIFIED AndroidManifest.xml** - Correctly removes problematic permissions using `tools:node="remove"`
4. **✅ INCREMENTED VERSION** to 1.0.66+66 for new submission
5. **✅ BUILT CLEAN APP BUNDLE** - Ready for Google Play submission
