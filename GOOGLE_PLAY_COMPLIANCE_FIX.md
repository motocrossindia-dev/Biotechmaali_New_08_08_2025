# Google Play Policy Compliance Fix - Summary

## 🚨 Issue Resolved
**Problem**: App was rejected due to `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` permission violation.
**Error**: "Permission use is not directly related to your app's core purpose."

## ✅ Changes Made

File: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- ❌ Removed: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>`
- ✅ Added maxSdkVersion to READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: `android:maxSdkVersion="32"`

### 2. **Added Google Play Compliant Photo Picker**
File: `lib/core/utils/photo_picker_util.dart`
- ✅ Created PhotoPickerUtil class using file_picker package
- ✅ No media permissions required - uses system picker
- ✅ Supports single/multiple image selection

### 3. **Added File Picker Dependency**
File: `pubspec.yaml`
- ✅ Added: `file_picker: ^8.1.3`

### 4. **Created Example Implementation**
File: `lib/src/widgets/example_photo_picker_widget.dart`

```

## 🚀 Implementation Guide

### For Future Image Selection Needs:
```dart
import '../core/utils/photo_picker_util.dart';

// Pick single image
File? image = await PhotoPickerUtil.pickSingleImage();

// Pick multiple images  
List<File>? images = await PhotoPickerUtil.pickMultipleImages(maxImages: 5);

// Validate image
if (image != null && PhotoPickerUtil.isValidImageFile(image)) {
  // Use the image
}
```
