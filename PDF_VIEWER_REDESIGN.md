- **Consistent Branding**: Matches the rest of the app's visual design

### 2. **Modern UI Design**

- Large PDF icon in white
- "Invoice Ready" title
- Order number badge with semi-transparent background
- Drop shadow for depth

- All buttons have subtle background tint for better visibility

#### Help Card

### 3. **Social Sharing Features**

#### WhatsApp Sharing (`_shareViaWhatsApp`)
```dart
- Uses WhatsApp deep link: whatsapp://send?text=...
- Includes order number in message if available
- Fallback to general share if WhatsApp not installed
- Shows helpful snackbar messages
```

**Message Format**:
```
"Check out my invoice for Order #12345: https://..."
```

#### Facebook Sharing (`_shareViaFacebook`)
```dart
- Uses native share sheet
- Shows instruction to select Facebook
- Includes invoice URL in message
```

**Note**: Direct Facebook posting requires Facebook SDK, but share sheet approach is:
- Simpler to implement
- Google Play compliant
- Works with all social apps

#### General Share (`_shareViaGeneral`)
```dart
- Opens native OS share sheet
- Supports all sharing apps (Email, Messages, etc.)
- Used for "More Share Options" button
- Also accessible via AppBar share icon
```

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- **SingleChildScrollView**: Maintains floating window compatibility
- **Flexible Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Text Overflow Protection**: All text has maxLines and ellipsis
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins

### 5. **Loading State**
- Centered loading indicator with app theme color
- "Opening PDF..." message
- Better UX during browser launch

### 6. **Package Dependencies**
```yaml
share_plus: ^12.0.0  # Already in pubspec.yaml
url_launcher: ^6.3.2  # Already in pubspec.yaml
```

**No new packages required!**

## Technical Implementation

### Colors Used
```dart
- cButtonGreen = Color(0xFF749F09)  // App primary color
- WhatsApp Green = Color(0xFF25D366)
- Facebook Blue = Color(0xFF1877F2)
- Info Blue = Colors.blue.shade50/700/900
```

### Key UI Elements
1. **Gradient Header**: `LinearGradient` with app green shades
2. **Card Shadows**: `BoxShadow` with controlled opacity
3. **Button Styling**: Consistent 14px radius, proper padding
4. **Icon Sizes**: 20-24px for buttons, 70px for main PDF icon
5. **Typography**: Bold titles, w500-w600 for body text

### Share Implementation Strategy
```dart
// WhatsApp - Try deep link first, fallback to share sheet
whatsapp://send?text=<URL_ENCODED_MESSAGE>

// Facebook - Use native share sheet
Share.share(message, subject: title)

// General - Native OS share functionality
Share.share(message, subject: title)
```
